    "\n",
    "* Find other lists of hot songs on the internet and scrape them too: having a bigger pool of songs will be awesome!\n",

The underground met the overground in the form of easily amassed, often free mp3 files. Pop met experimental met rap met rock met electronic, sometimes in the same song (see: OutKast’s “B.O.B.”). M.I.A. combined geopolitics with hip-hop and postmodern production on “Paper Planes.” Hot Chip, LCD Soundsystem, and the Knife offered heart-tugging odes built for the dancefloor. Jay-Z and Beyoncé started off the decade with brilliant radio hits like “Crazy in Love” and “Big Pimpin’,” and capped it by <a href=\"http://ew.com/article/2009/08/31/jay-z-beyonce-grizzly-bear/\">embracing indie rock in Williamsburg</a>. Meanwhile, everyone put their playlists on shuffle, ricocheting between the White Stripes’ “Fell in Love With a Girl,” Missy Elliott’s “Get Yr Freak On,” and Justin Timberlake’s “My Love” without thinking twice. With the playing field more level than ever, at its best, the 2000s were a freewheeling musical meritocracy. May the best song win.</p>\n",

Seemingly going for as many head bangs as hip flips, “La Rock 01” takes a pugilist’s mentality when it comes to dancefloor takeover-- put up a fight or get knocked out. Arbez pulled off the industrial-tinged techno attack a full four years before his famous French countrymen famously mangled their groove with 2005’s fuzzed-to-oblivion <i>Human After All</i>, and “La Rock 01” in particular sounds like the top of a blog-house family tree that’s still splitting bandwidth on a daily basis. And Arbez makes the machines work for him, whether they’re buzzing like bees on speedballs or causing EQ meters to snap into a billion pieces thanks to a what sounds like a demonic copy machine’s futuristic head-rush chomp. The 1990s promised a electro takeover of all things rock-- it didn’t happen. But Vitalic begins the decade by riding lightning as hard and fast as any musclebound fist-pumper-- and priming the formula that would eventually give rise to megawatt crosses and pyramids around the world. –Ryan Dombal</p>\n",

The odd chord progression stays precisely the same for the entire song, but the melody “changes some,” in Newsom’s phrase. So does the tenor of its lyric, from the ooze and floozies and alliteration of its first few verses to the manic, bolting horse and internal assonance (and therefore suggestion of “whores”) in the last few. None of that is obvious at first, but all of it works in the service of the song’s needle-sharp emotional sting. –Douglas Wolk</span></p>\n",

But the rallying, march-like feel of the track suggests that when Spunt insists, “I won’t end up like them at all,” he’s not pointing at his musical brethren, but scene come-latelys that “wash away what we create.” Or maybe the song isn’t that literal– certainly the music’s hazy hooks stand up to multiple interpretations.

After spending 20 years chasing fame, Pulp’s Jarvis Cocker realized it didn’t suit him much, releasing first the 1997 hangover LP </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Is Hardcore</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and then the more introspective and conflicted </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Life</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. “All my achievements...range from pathetic to piss-poor,” Cocker claims before celebrating the titular sunrise of early semi-retirement. The band itself didn’t seem to want to go as patiently into that good night, closing the song with three minutes of its most ferocious work, a snarling, climatic build and a fitting send-off for one of the more creative acts of our time. –Scott Plagenhoef</span></p>\n",

But “Oxford Comma” is compositionally brilliant; clocking in at 3:15, it’s a microcosm of momentum-building, beginning with a slow thudding beat before, in short order, ramping to its double-chorus finale, resplendent and victorious without ever being angry or loud or fast. Montessori, finishing school, whatever it took: “Oxford Comma” is well-mannered punk rock. –Andrew Gaerig</span></p>\n",

Jay might not have understood a word of the original, but he heard a dope beat (that “Knight Rider” theme was always meant to destroy dancefloors) and an opportunity to flex regal. And Jay just tore this thing apart, protesting the Iraq war before it was cool and calling himself the black Brad Pitt, taking one of ya chicks straight from under ya armpit– which is </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cool.

Well, the King of Pop is dead. Was that what he sounded like? How about the sound of global pop culture circa 2009? From heartfelt (OK, gloriously flawed) singing to running a collector’s-mentality record label, the Tough Alliance are way more indie than they’d probably like to admit. But they’ve seldom sounded more purely pop than on “Silly Crimes”, the flagship track from their maiden EP as label owners. Bass-heavy dance beats, sweetly yearning hooks, neon synths, utopian strings, and tropical sound effects– it’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New Waves</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, not “new wave.” And as frivolous delinquency goes, it’s pretty near a perfect crime. –Marc Hogan</span></p>\n",

She’s crazy, she’s ringing alarms, and– most important– she’s Beyoncé, almighty one-stop entertainer beamed down from Planet Perfection.

She puts on a good front: “You must not know ’bout me, I could have another you in a minute,” she sings, hand on hip. But the cracked delivery of “another you” gives her away– she sounds vulnerable, crushed, human.
